*coding problem 1*

Write a MIPS assembly code that takes an integer n as an input and provides the
corresponding Fibonacci number as the output. For instance, if n = 3, the output should be 2, for
n = 7, the output should be 13 and so on. The index for first number of the sequence is zero.


*coding problem 2*

Implement a binary search algorithm in MIPS assembly. To test your code, have the user enter a
sorted array with 10 elements in ascending order and then a search query. The program should
print index of the element if it is present in the array, otherwise it should print that the number is
not present in the array.
